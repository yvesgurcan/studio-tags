Use the drop down menus at the top of the page to view the currently available training for CompTIA certifications.<p>The natural progression in the IT career path after A+ certification is to learn networking and certify your knowledge so current and future employers can be confident when they offer you a raise or new employment that you can be an integral part in the life cycle and development of the business computer network.  An individual certified as a Network+ technician has proven himself or herself to be fundamentally competent; has proven a solid base of knowledge and expertise in networking technologies. <p>The CBT Nuggets CompTIA Network+ series builds on the quality instruction delivered in the CompTIA A+ certification series.  The training is very well done.  You'll be amazed at the amount of information presented in this series.  True to the CBT Nuggets concept, nothing is taken for granted.  The series starts very basic but then also covers intermediate and ultimately the most advanced networking concepts. <p>The CBT Nuggets Network+ Certification Package is thorough, comprehensive, and completely covers the objectives for the recently updated (January of 2002) CompTIA Network+ curriculum.  Watching these videos is very similar to attending classroom instruction.  You'll get a combination of theory and practical instruction as you progress through the lessons.  The innovative approach used by CBT Nuggets provides hands-on experience through the eyes of the instructor.

Veteran CBT Nuggets instructor Greg Shields has passed over 30 IT exams in his career.  He’s been an MCSE almost as long as there’s been an MCSE, and he knows his way around Microsoft certification.  That deep and broad experience is why we’ve asked him to produce our 70-414 MCSE: Server Infrastructure capstone training.\n\nIn this exam prep series, Greg speaks directly to Microsoft’s exam objectives.

It’s a targeted study guide that’ll make you a wiser Windows Server administrator while tightly focusing on your 70-414 study efforts.\n\nGood luck with that final step towards Microsoft MCSE certification.

Greg has been recognized by all three major virtual platform vendors for his influence in these technologies, having received the highest honors of each:  Microsoft’s MVP, VMware’s vExpert, and recently Citrix’s CTP awards. More importantly, Greg’s also a long-time CBT Nuggets instructor that many IT pros worldwide have come to trust.\n\nIn this series, Greg walks you through the technologies that get your Microsoft Private Cloud operational.

The training covers the exam objectives from the perspective of a \"real-world\" CCNP, teaching you what you need to know to successfully function as a CCNP in the workplace.  The best thing about this training is the additional material included because <a href=\"http://www.cbtnuggets.com/webapp/trainers?id=10\"> our CCNP trainer</a> has been working with Cisco technologies forever and a day and knows that there are certain things you need to know that may not be on any test, but are important on the job and in your development as a network engineer.  When you watch this series, you'll learn switching; Cisco proprietary switching, standards-based theories and concepts, and real honest-to-goodness \"what makes the gears move\" and \"watch tick\" kind of information.  And after you're certified, the 30-minute \"video-per-concept\" format makes it very easy to pop in a video for a refresher or for continuing education training.  The <a href=\"http://www.cbtnuggets.com/webapp/product?id=41\"> CCNA package</a> is the prerequisite for this series, so we can assume knowledge gained in the CCNA series and cover the concepts in much greater depth.

The new Network+ video series covers each and every topic in the latest blueprint for the 2011 N10-005 exam, and each Nugget maps to a specific exam objective.","expertises":["53bb2a7719b8446f8640bb9e"],"paths":[],"path_expertises":[],"vendors":[],"vendor_expertises":[],"difficulty":"54aad9d771874fd6a9154b01","seoslug":"comptia-network-plus-n10-005","total_seconds":89531,"updated_at":"2018-10-05T15:52:52.957Z","archive":true,"course_image":"54aae04ee7b573a4e100000a","legacy_seoslugs":["ctia_n10_005_u"],"__v":7,"meta_updated_at":"2018-05-15T22:53:18.961Z","created_at":"2015-02-12T01:12:14.571Z","is_google":false,"copyright_number":[],"legacy_supplemental_files":false,"reviewers":[{"role":"quality","assigned_to":null},{"role":"technical","assigned_to":null},{"role":"peer","assigned_to":null}],"version":"1.6","release_manager":"2160287","employers":[" "],"practice_exams":[],"propagate_reviewer_changes":true,"propagate_trainer_changes":true,"salary":{"median":50000},"testimonials":[],"topic_overview":" "},{"id":"5307a4251999db31e378e816","royalties":[{"trainer":"53078abc1999db31e378b2e2","royalty":2.25},{"trainer":"53078abe1999db31e378b2ef","royalty":0}],"legacy_series":1305,"subtitle":"Upgrading Your Skills to MCSA Windows 8","description":"This Microsoft Windows 8 training course with Tim Warner covers the skills to upgrade from Windows 7 MCITP to a Windows 8 MCSA. \r\n<br><br>\r\nRelated area of expertise:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Desktop Support</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br>\r\nRecommended skills: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Experience in supporting Windows 7</li>\r\n<li>Basic understanding of Active Directory, Group Policy, TCP/IP networking</li>\r\n<li>Experience with cloud technologies (public, private, hybrid)</li>\r\n<li>Recognition of support issues concerning mobile devices (laptops, tablet computers, smartphones)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRecommended equipment:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A virtualized lab environment would be ideal: 1 domain controller, 1 member server, 1 Windows 8 client computer, 1 Windows 7 client computer\r\n<li>Sign up for free evaluations of Office 365 and Windows Intune</li>\r\n<li>Optional: Windows RT tablet device and a Windows Phone 8 (will help greatly)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRelated certifications: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>MCSA Windows 8</li>\r\n<li>MCSE Windows Server 2012</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRelated job functions:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Desktop Support Technician</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<br><br>\r\nMicrosoft exam 70-689, Upgrading Your Skills to MCSA Windows 8, is a shortcut method for Windows 7 MCITPs to attain the Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) credential in Windows 8 Support.

You begin the course by understanding network fundamentals, discussing topics such as the OSI Model, switch and router functionality, and cabling standards. From there, you move quickly into understanding the differences between IOS and IOS-XR (Cisco’s service provider-specific OS), configuration of routing protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6, network services, and device management.\n<br><br> \nUnlike most other Cisco courses, there are no pre-requisites for the Service Provider SPNGN1 certification.

As a systems engineer consultant, I hired Emilio to help me with two network infrastructure contracts I was involved in.  In one of those contracts we ran into some WAN connectivity devices from an unnamed vendor that just wouldn't work.  Our implementation was flawless, and per the vendor, these devices had never been used in the capacity we were configuring.  Emilio reverse engineered the devices and re-configured them at a low-level and we were fully successful with the devices and the project.  The vendor then solicited Emilio to teach it's engineers the re-configuration steps and the theory behind his successful implementation.  That's what makes Emilio second to none.  He understands and can do, he understands at such a granular level that he can adapt and succeed where success is not apparent.  I am personally very thankful that Emilio has agreed to be the CBT Nuggets full-time Cisco trainer.  I am certified as a CCNA, but I'll have to be honest, before I watched Emilio's videos I was a \"paper CCNA\".  I didn't know that I was a paper CCNA until I watched the videos, and I certainly don't feel like one now.

Exam 642-513: HIPS is one of five exams required to earn the Cisco Certified Security Professional certification.\n\nThe CCSP-HIPS video series contains:\n- Introduction to the Cisco HIPS Series\n- Introduction to the CSA\n- Configuring and Installing the CSA MC\n- Installing the CSA Agent\n- Configuring Groups on the CSA MC\n- The CSA Agent Kit - Host Management (http://www.cbtnuggets.com/webapp/theater?op=view&id=161)  \n- Policy Configuration\n- Working with Variables\n- Working with Application Classes\n- Working with Rules (part 1)\n- Working with Rules (part 2)\n- Managing Events\n- Generating Reports\n- Application Deployment Investigation and Reporting\n- Application Behavior Investigation and Reporting\n\nPrerequisites\nA thorough understanding of Cisco networking such as a CCNA certification (http://www.cbtnuggets.com/series?id=41) or equivalent knowledge is recommended before viewing these videos.\nHere's what you'll learn in each video of the CCSP-HIPS series:\n\nVideo 1 - \"Introduction to the Cisco HIPS Series\" - Introduces you to Cisco Security Agent (CSA). Familiarizes you with the CCSP - HIPS 642-513 certification exam. Separates the exam content into five main domains and discusses the exam.\n\nVideo 2 - \"Introduction to the CSA\" - Walks you through CSA and its role in Cisco' Self-Defending Network (SDN). Describes how CSA works on workstations, hosts and servers to enforce the security of network traffic. You'll learn about CSA architecture, the features of CSA and CSA Management Center (MC) components. You'll also see a portrait of typical network attack and how CSA handles it.\n\nVideo 3 - \"Configuring and Installing the CSA MC\" - You'll learn about the CSA interface and how to configure security policies. (Understanding the interface is necessary to pass the exam.) Plus, you'll learn the CSA MC installation requirements.\n\nVideo 4 - \"Installing the CSA Agent\" - This video shows you how to customize CSA MC installation using installation kits. You'll learn system-specific installation requirements and how to use CSA to monitor system functions and analyze operations, and you'll see how CSA proactively blocks malicious activity attempts. \n\nVideo 5 - \"Configuring Groups on the CSA MC\" - This video provides an overview of groups and why to use them. It covers a variety of configuration topics, including: setting security requirements for groups of similar hosts; streamlining the process of assigning common policies to groups and sending out updates and alerts; configuring groups; and generating and distributing rule groups before policies take effect.\n\nVideo 6 - \"The CSA Agent Kit\" - Agent kits make your job as a network administrator easier. They simplify installing CSA (along with pre-existing security policies and rules) onto a host. Learn how to build agent kits step by step. This video walks you through agent kit status levels, rebooting options and controlling host registration by defining IP addresses.\n\nVideo 7 -\"Host Management\" - Protect yourself from structured and unstructured network attacks with effective policies. Learn how to generate solid security policies. This video provides you with an overview and key considerations of security policy. It also discusses security policy issues and configuring policy elements on CSA MC.\n\nVideo 9 -\"Working with Variables\" - Why create the same rules over and over to cover hosts across the network? Simplify the process by connecting similar components using variables. Variables can connect data sets, file sets, network address sets, network services sets, registry sets, COM component sets and query settings.\n\nVideo 10 - \"Working with Application Classes\" - Gain an overview of application classes. Understand the difference between static and dynamic classes. Learn to configure application classes in CSA MC.\n\nVideo 11 - \"Working with Rules (part 1)\" - This video shows you rules for using workstations in a host-based IPS environment. It also covers managing files and registry keys, and shows how to handle COM components and network access. You'll understand CSA rules, major rule types, rules common to both UNIX and Microsoft, rule configuration and rule prioritization for specific actions.\n\nVideo 12 - \"Working with Rules (part 2)\" - Learn about rules specific to UNIX or Windows. Windows-specific rules include clipboard access control, COM component access, file version control, kernel control, NT event log, registry access, service restart and sniffer & protocol detection. UNIX-specific rules include network interface control, resource access control, root kit/kernel protection and Syslog control.\n\nVideo 13 - \"Managing Events\" -  Learn about CSA MC event log and event monitor. This video discusses event log management and event management wizard. It also explains event sets and alerts/system status.\n\nVideo 14 - \"Generating Reports\" - Some activities require ongoing monitoring, such as upgrades and patches. Configuring rules in CSA MC lets you log specific events. Learn how to generate the following reports: events by severity, events by groups, host detail, policy detail and group detail.\n\nVideo 15 - \"Application Deployment Investigation and Reporting\" - Learn about monitoring applications running on host systems (end-user workstations, servers, etc.). Other topics include: configuring the CSA MC to perform application deployment investigation on all installed network applications; analyzing and compiling data on all network host applications and creating application deployment reports.\n\nVideo 16 - \"Application Behavior Investigation and Reporting\" - Detecting and rectifying application violations and locating undesirable intrusions and activities are essential security activities. This video gives you an overview of behavior Analysis in CSA MC. It also explains the following reports: file event, registry event, COM event, network event and summary.\n\nAll trademarks and copyrights are the property of their respective holders.","expertises":[],"archive":false,"is_complete":false,"copyright_number":[],"legacy_supplemental_files":false,"updated_at":"2018-10-05T16:03:36.978Z","seoslug":"retired-cisco-ccsp-exam-pack-642-513-hips","meta_updated_at":"2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","created_at":"2014-11-17T23:45:40.535Z","reviewers":[],"version":"1.3","release_manager":"2160287","employers":[],"legacy_seoslugs":[],"path_expertises":[],"paths":[],"practice_exams":[],"propagate_reviewer_changes":true,"propagate_trainer_changes":true,"testimonials":[],"vendor_expertises":[],"vendors":[],"__v":3},{"id":"5307a3b11999db31e378e738","description":"<b>Note: Cisco retired its 642-436 exam on March 1, 2011.

Voice over IP is now the “hot topic” – it's no longer bleeding edge. Businesses around the world are realizing the cost savings, efficiency, and just plain “coolness” of combining their telephone and data networks into one unified system. Today, it's rare to find a company not using VoIP! That said, there is a massive shortage of qualified people who can implement and support VoIP systems. \n\nJust like the original Cisco CCNA, CCNA Voice hits the high points of the major VoIP technologies common in Cisco voice networks. These include:\n\n• Cisco Unified Communication Manager (CUCM – aka CallManager)\n• Cisco Unified Communication Manager Express (CME)\n• Cisco Unity Connection\n• Cisco Presence\n\nSo, in one series, you're learning to work with four major products, which looks awesome on a resume! \n\nThis series goes far beyond the Cisco Certification exam. Jeremy adds extra material on the core products you deal with every day in the real-world: CUCM and CME. Of course, he carefully notes this to keep you from studying too much information if you're preparing for the certification exam. Expect to walk away with the best of exam prep as well as real world skills!\n\nOnce you have gone through this training, you'll be a part of a small, select group of people who really understand VoIP technology. You'll also be able to manage day-to-day operations of the VoIP system in small, mid-size, and large businesses. Businesses everywhere are looking for a person who can handle their basic routing & switching functions (CCNA) along with their voice network (CCNA Voice).","expertises":["53bb2a7819b8446f8640bba7"],"paths":["54aad8ae71874fd581338a1b"],"path_expertises":["54aad8af71874fd581338a22"],"vendors":["54aad9b071874fd6820d60ea"],"vendor_expertises":["54aad9b171874fd6820d60f1"],"difficulty":"54aad9da71874fd6a9154b02","seoslug":"cisco-ccna-voice-icomm-640-461","total_seconds":68771,"updated_at":"2019-09-06T00:07:52.163Z","archive":false,"course_image":"54aae03bfc9178a8e1000016","legacy_seoslugs":["cisco-voip-ccna-voice-icomm-640-461"],"__v":11,"is_google":false,"copyright_number":[],"legacy_supplemental_files":false,"meta_updated_at":"2018-01-14T20:15:25.787Z","created_at":"2015-02-12T01:12:14.363Z","reviewers":[{"role":"quality","assigned_to":null},{"role":"technical","assigned_to":null},{"role":"peer","assigned_to":null}],"version":"1.9","release_manager":"2160287","employers":["AT&T","Verizon","Salesforce"],"salary":{"median":70000},"testimonials":[],"topic_overview":"Obtain the knowledge required to administer Cisco Voice and Unified Communications solutions.","practice_exams":[],"propagate_reviewer_changes":true,"propagate_trainer_changes":true,"is_skill":false},{"id":"5307a3f41999db31e378e7b7","royalties":[{"trainer":"53078abc1999db31e378b2e2","royalty":2.25},{"trainer":"53078abc1999db31e378b2e6","royalty":10}],"legacy_series":1089,"subtitle":"","description":"<I>Note: The certification exam associated with this training has been retired by Cisco.

white hat hacker video training course with James Conrad covers how to legally protect against hacker security breaches, including virtualization, reconnaissance, footprinting, social engineering, scanning, sniffing, cryptography, and more.\n<br><br>\nMost IT professionals are far too busy with daily tasks and projects to commit themselves to a serious study of security. Problem is, hackers are quite serious about your security and how to exploit it. If a security breach occurs at a company, it can cost millions of dollars, the loss of a priceless reputation, private customer information, and the very jobs of the IT professionals who often get blamed for weak security practices. One of the best ways to ensure good security is to know what hackers do to circumvent it. Security concepts and facts alone do not protect your systems. However, knowledge and experience in exactly how hackers exploit weaknesses will help you to potentially avoid embarrassing security breaches in the future. This training helps validate your ethical hacking skills and can make you a more desired IT security pro.\n<br><br>\n<b>Recommended Experience</b>\n<ul> \n<li>Familiarity with Windows of all versions, back to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003</li> \n<li>Familiarity with Linux is not necessary but recommended (a video early in the course provides basic Kali Linux training that is sufficient for the learner to complete the course)</li> \n</ul> \n<b>Recommended Equipment</b>\n<ul> \n<li>Whatever equipment is being used to view the videos (except a smartphone or tablet) is sufficient to create a basic lab environment in which the learner can mirror demonstrations in the videos.

For the end customer outside the company, many services seem to just “show up,” but behind the scenes is an IT department helping to deliver these services. For IT departments to run well there are processes that need to happen. In a small IT department, each person takes on many — if not all — of the processes and manages them individually. But in a big department, the processes need to be shared among job roles, standardized, and managed for maximum efficiency.\n<br><br> \nThat's what IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL<sup>®</sup>) and IT Service Management (ITSM) are all about: managing the processes within an IT department to make the department run well and to ensure resources are available as needed.

Office 365 services are more intertwined than before, so we explore how these different technologies (SharePoint Online, Exchange Online, and Skype for Business Online) are integrated in Office 365. \n<br><br>\nWe also discuss the consideration of clients and end users in terms of planning, deployment, management, and reporting with these services. We look at the use of public web sites, as well as the planning and management of site collections in SharePoint Online, and discuss the mail migration process, data protection reports, and groups used in Exchange Online. \n<br><br> \nThroughout the course, we introduce how to automate the management of these services using PowerShell, so you can script these tasks, allowing you to become more efficient in your day-to-day operations.

This training covers motherboards, hard drives, RAM, video, networking and CPU's as well as DOS and Windows (98, 2000, NT, XP and ME) Operating Systems.<p>This A+ Certification Package is thorough, comprehensive, and completely covers the objectives for the CompTIA A+ curriculum (including the new objectives announced for November 2003). Watching these videos is very similar to attending classroom instruction. You'll get a combination of theory and practical instruction as you progress through the lessons. The innovative approach used by CBT Nuggets provides hands-on experience through the eyes of the instructor. Go to our free videos page and watch selected videos from the A+ series for free.<p>\"The CompTIA A+ series was designed with attention to detail. We searched for months for the perfect instructor. Many companies would be satisfied with a mere expert, but that wouldn't be what you've come to expect from CBT Nuggets. Chris Rees is not only an A+ expert, but he relates to the student. He has a way of explaining the most technical concepts in the simplest of terms. I was the technical reviewer for these videos, and let me tell you, I was excited to see each video. Chris made me laugh, got me interested and excited, but more importantly, made me learn things I never knew that I didn't know. The production of these videos lasted almost 4 months, but our precise, \"perfectionist\" type attitude really paid off in the quality of instruction this series represents.

Use the drop down menus at the top of the page to view the currently available training for CompTIA certifications.<p>The CompTIA A+ series was designed with attention to detail.  We searched for months for the perfect instructor.  Many companies would be satisfied with a mere expert, but that wouldn't be what you've come to expect from CBT Nuggets.  Chris Rees is not only an A+ expert, but he relates to the student.  He has a way of explaining the most technical concepts in the simplest of terms.  I was the technical reviewer for these videos, and let me tell you, I was excited to see each  video.  Chris made me laugh, got me interested and excited, but more importantly, made me learn things I never knew that I didn't know.  The production of these videos lasted almost 4 months, but our precise, \"perfectionist\" type attitude really paid off in the quality of instruction this series represents.  I'm proud to be a part of the A+ Certification package. <p>   - Dan Charbonneau, MCSE 2000, Master CNE, CCNA<br>     Founder and President, CBT Nuggets, Inc.<p>The CBT Nuggets A+ Certification Package is thorough, comprehensive, and completely covers the objectives for the CompTIA A+ curriculum.  Watching these videos is very similar to attending classroom instruction.  You'll get a combination of theory and practical instruction as you progress through the lessons.  The innovative approach used by CBT Nuggets provides hands-on experience through the eyes of the instructor.  Go to our free videos section and view 3 of the videos from the A+ series for free.

Passing both exams is your first step towards higher-level Cisco certification, and trainer Jeremy Cioara has mapped these CCNA training videos to the 640-816 test. This CCNA training is not to be missed.\n\nHere's how one user described Jeremy's training: \"By the way, Jeremy Cioara has to be by far one of the BEST Cisco trainers I have ever had the privilege to learn from overall. He not only keeps your attention but his energy is contagious and he provides the information at a level where you grasp it rather easily.\"\n\n*** The 640-816 exam expired on Sept. 30, 2013. Currently, the only ICND2 exam available will be 200-101.
